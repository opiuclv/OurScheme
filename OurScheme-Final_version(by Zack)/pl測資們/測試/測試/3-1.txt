當測試「Test case 1 of 3」時，Input為>>1
int x ;
x=10;
{ int x ;
  x = 10 ;
}
cout << x ;
string str ;
str = "This is a fine day.\n" ;
float y ;
{ float yy ;
  yy=y+yy;
  yy=y
  ; 
}
y = 20 ;
Done(); int x ; cout << y ;
x = 10 ;
<<

正確的輸出應該是>>Our-C running ...
> Definition of x entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Definition of str entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Definition of y entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Our-C exited ...<<

你的程式的輸出是>>Our-C running ...
> Definition of x entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Statement executed ...
> Definition of str entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Definition of y entered ...
> Definition of yy entered ...
> Statement executed ...
> Our-C exited ...<<
